### 3. Task & Assessment Questions

|Sr No.| Learning Objective to be met| Tasks to be performed by the students | Assessment questions aligned to the task |
|------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|1.|	The student will be able to identify the components required for 4:1 multiplexer circuit using 2:1 mux and place them on canvas.	|Student picks and places the required components on the canvas.	|Select the components required and place on canvas.
|2.|The student will be able to connect the components and construct a 4:1 multiplexer using multiplexer logic.	|1.  Clicks on connecting wire. <br>2. Clicks on start node/gate. <br>3. Clicks on end node/next gate. <br>4. Repeats above step for each component|	Make the connections to construct the circuit.
|3.|	The student will be able to change the inputs applied to the 4:1 multiplexer.|	1. Clicks on input button D0, D1, D2 or D3 to set it to 1/0. <br>2. Clicks on select input buttons (S0,S1) to set them to 1/0. </br> 3.Clicks on Enable to set it to 1/0.	|Change the input conditions for the combinational circuit for circuit verification.
|4.|The students will be able to examine the working of 4:1 multiplexer using mux logic.|	1. Set combinations of input one by one.<br>2. Observe the output.<br>3. Input the observed values in the truth table.<br>4. Submit the truth table for evaluation.|	Examine the circuit outputs sum and carry for various combinations of input and output and fill up the truth table and submit your answers.|
